    """

    Function similar to the matplotlib.pyplot.fill_between function but
    for 3D plots.

    input:

        ax -> The axis where the function will plot.

        x1 -> 1D array. x coordinates of the first line.
        y1 -> 1D array. y coordinates of the first line.
        z1 -> 1D array. z coordinates of the first line.

        x2 -> 1D array. x coordinates of the second line.
        y2 -> 1D array. y coordinates of the second line.
        z2 -> 1D array. z coordinates of the second line.

    modes:
        mode = 1 -> Fill between the lines using the shortest distance between
                    both. Makes a lot of single trapezoids in the diagonals
                    between lines and then adds them into a single collection.

        mode = 2 -> Uses the lines as the edges of one only 3d polygon.

    Other parameters (for matplotlib):

        c -> the color of the polygon collection.
        alpha -> transparency of the polygon collection.
